# Welcome to my Portfolio Website!
## Brief Introfuction

Hi! I'm Alex Klein, a self taught **front-end developer** living in Hungary. Studied accounting in High-School, but always wanted to try programming as Im fond of it. Its the little happy moments I get when I solve a difficult task that keeps me going.

## What is the project about?

I aim to create something both visually pleasing and informative  about my coding journey. That's what this site is all about. Most of my work made easy to reach and view on one single website.
